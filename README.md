# Hybrid UI + API Automation Framework

This project is designed to test both **UI and API** functionalities of the `revamp-qa-admin-api.vcheckglobal.net` and `revamp-qa.vcheckglobal.net` platforms using Playwright (for UI) and `requests`/custom libraries (for API). It integrates Salesforce (SF) test data and utility methods via a reusable library.
